## Presentation

*Score* is an interactive sequencer for intermedia authoring. It allows to create flexible and interactive scenarios and is especially designed for live performance, art installations, museography or any context requiring a precise and interactive execution of timed events.

*Score* brings timeline-based precise automation authoring as offerd in modern DAWs as well as flexible and interactive event triggering as offered in cue-based software in a unified environment. These two paradigms can be combined and used in parallel or hierarchically in *Score*'s scenario, which provides a high level of control and of openness, as is required by todayâ€™s creation.
