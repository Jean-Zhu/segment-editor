# Process overview: Scenario

## Presentation

The scenario process is the heart of <em>score</em>, its <em>raison d'Ãªtre</em>.
It allows to sequence the various objects presented before in a non-linear timeline.

When opening <em>score</em> for the first time, the blank document is a root Time interval, the blue line at the top, which
contains a single scenario.

## Full-view and hierarchy

One can go inside sub-scenarios by using the Full-view feature of the interval.

By double-clicking on a interval name, it switches to the main view.
